# AI Risk Score & Personalized Upskilling: A User Guide

This codelab provides a comprehensive guide to using the "AI Risk Score - V3" application, a tool designed to help you understand and mitigate your risk of job displacement in the age of artificial intelligence. This application is more than just a risk calculator; it's a personalized upskilling recommender that empowers you to take control of your career trajectory. We will explore its functionalities step-by-step, focusing on how to use the application to assess your risk, identify valuable skills, and track your progress over time.

## Understanding the Application's Core Concepts
Duration: 00:05

Before diving into the application, it's important to grasp the core concepts underpinning its functionality. The "AI Risk Score - V3" application uses a multi-factor risk model to calculate your unique "AI-Q score". This score reflects your vulnerability to AI-driven changes in the job market. The application considers various aspects of your professional profile, including your occupation, education, skills, and the broader economic and technological landscape.

The application is built upon actuarial and economic models and demonstrates how acquiring new skills, particularly general and portable skills, can reduce your risk and potentially lower your "AI displacement insurance" premium.

## Navigating the Application
Duration: 00:03

The application is divided into three main sections, accessible via the sidebar:

*   **Risk Assessment:** This is where you input your professional details to calculate your current AI-Q score and understand the factors contributing to it.
*   **Upskilling Path:** This section helps you discover recommended skills and learning resources tailored to your profile to mitigate your risk.
*   **Progress Tracking:** Here, you can monitor how your upskilling efforts impact your risk score and hypothetical premium over time.

Let's explore each section in detail.

## Risk Assessment: Calculating Your AI-Q Score
Duration: 00:10

The "Risk Assessment" section is the starting point for understanding your potential vulnerability to AI-driven job displacement. Here, you'll provide information about your professional profile and the current environment to calculate your AI-Q score.

1.  **Input Your Profile:** The section is divided into "Your Profile" and "Environmental Modifiers". Under "Your Profile," use the select boxes and sliders to provide details about your:
    *   Current Occupation
    *   Years of Experience
    *   Highest Education Level
    *   Education Field
    *   School Tier
    *   Company Type

2.  **Environmental Modifiers:** In the "Environmental Modifiers" section, select the most relevant scenarios for:
    *   Economic Climate
    *   AI Innovation Pace

3.  **Current Skill Progress:** Use the sliders to indicate your current progress in both general and firm-specific skills. This is a percentage from 0-100.

4.  **Calculate AI-Q Score:** Once you've entered all the information, click the "Calculate AI-Q Score" button. The application will then process your inputs and display your results.

<aside class="negative">
Ensure you provide accurate and realistic information for the most meaningful results. The AI-Q score is only as good as the data you input.
</aside>

## Interpreting the Risk Assessment Results
Duration: 00:07

After calculating your AI-Q score, the application displays key metrics:

*   **Idiosyncratic Risk (Vi(t)):** This score reflects your individual vulnerability based on your skills, experience, and company.
*   **Systematic Risk (Hi):** This score represents the overall risk level associated with your occupation, considering economic and technological factors.
*   **Estimated Monthly Premium (Pmonthly):** This is a hypothetical insurance premium based on your assessed risk.

The application also provides "Risk Factor Contributions" charts, visually showing the impact of different factors on your Idiosyncratic and Systematic Risk.  These charts help you understand which areas contribute most to your risk profile.

Additionally, expandable sections give detailed explanations of each factor, including the underlying formulas and how your inputs influence the results. This helps you understand the *why* behind your score.

## Upskilling Path: Identifying and Acquiring Key Skills
Duration: 00:10

The "Upskilling Path" section is designed to help you identify and acquire the skills needed to mitigate your risk.

1.  **Select Your Occupation:**  Choose your current occupation from the select box. The application will then display a list of "Recommended High-Impact Skills," divided into "General (Portable) Skills" and "Firm-Specific Skills."

2.  **Skill Gap Analysis:** The application provides a "Skill Gap Analysis" radar chart (conceptual at this stage). This chart shows your current skill proficiency (based on the "Risk Assessment" inputs) against recommended levels. While it's conceptual now, a full implementation would involve actual skill proficiency assessments.

3.  **Personalized Learning Resources:**  The application provides a table of "Personalized Learning Resources" for different skills. You can filter the resources by skill type (All, general, firm-specific) using the radio buttons.

4.  **Career Path Diversification:** Use the "Career Path Diversification" tool to simulate a transition to a lower-risk occupation.  Select a target occupation and the number of months into the transition. The application will recalculate your Systematic Risk and estimated monthly premium based on the new occupation.

<aside class="positive">
Focus on acquiring general (portable) skills, as these have a greater impact on reducing your Idiosyncratic Risk.
</aside>

## Progress Tracking: Monitoring Your Risk Reduction
Duration: 00:10

The "Progress Tracking" section allows you to monitor how your upskilling efforts and career transitions impact your AI Risk Score and estimated monthly premium over time.

1.  **Update Your Progress:** Use the sliders to update your progress in general and firm-specific skills.  The application will retain your previous inputs, allowing you to track your improvement over time.

2.  **Log New Progress:** Click the "Log New Progress" button to record your updated skill levels. The application will then recalculate your AI-Q score and premium and append the results to your historical data.

3.  **Historical Performance:** The application displays "Historical Performance" charts, showing the trends in your Idiosyncratic Risk, Systematic Risk, and Monthly Premium over time. These charts visually demonstrate the impact of your upskilling efforts.  A skill proficiency trend chart also tracks your progress in general and firm-specific skills.

4.  **Impact Summary**: This section shows the overall change in your Idiosyncratic Risk and estimated monthly premium over the tracked period. This provides a quantitative summary of your progress.

<aside class="negative">
Remember that the "Progress Tracking" section relies on the initial AI-Q score calculated in the "Risk Assessment" section.  Be sure to calculate your initial score before tracking your progress. Also, remember to update other factors in the Risk Assessment as they change (occupation, experience, etc) for a more accurate simulation.
